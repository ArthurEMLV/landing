		<h3>Who I am</h3>
		<img class="avatar" src="images/seb.png" alt="Arthur Dupeyrot">
		<p>
			I am a student at EMLV business school who wants to act in an eco-responsible way by selling fruit and vegetable seeds to make people understand that it is not that difficult to create their own vegetable garden.
		</p>

		<h2>Information</h2>
			<img src="images/fruits.avif" alt="Example of fruits we sell">

			<p>
				We deliver fruit and vegetable seeds to you to act in an eco-frienfly way and help you create your own vegetable garden. All you have to do is water your box.
				The seeds are delivered to your home and come from France. They will be delivered in a cardboard box so that you only have to water them. This allows you to have your own fruits and vegetables even if you don't have a garden. Feel free to contact with my email: arthurdupey@gmail.com.
